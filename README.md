# Kotlin Collection Processing Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue that can arise when checking for empty collections in Kotlin after performing filtering or other collection operations. The `isEmpty()` check may produce unexpected results, particularly with larger collections or more complex filter logic. The provided code shows an example, and a solution is offered to mitigate this issue.

## Problem Description

The main issue is a potential misinterpretation of the result of a filter operation. The program filters a list for even numbers.  However, simply checking `isEmpty()` might not provide sufficient information about the result of the operation.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking the size of the filtered collection before performing any conditional logic based on the assumption of emptiness.
